    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Hello, pasta lovers. You never need to make box mac and cheese again. Enter this basic White Sauce Pasta! This is
        a
        staple recipe in our house. The basic cream sauce is so creamy and full of flavor, and get this: it doesn&apos;t

        cream! All you need is a handful of ingredients you probably already have on hand. It takes just 10 minutes:
        enough time
        to make the pasta. Eat it straight up, as a pasta side dish, or add more raw or cooked veggies to the sauce. A

        <li>
            <h4>Main Ingredients:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Pasta of any shape</li>
                <li>Salted butter</li>
                <li>Garlic</li>
                <li>Flour</li>
                <li>Milk</li>
                <li>Salt</li>
                <li>Parmesan cheese</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>
    </p>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <p>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Measure out all the ingredients first, and don&apos;t leave the stove! The cooking process goes quickly, so you don&apos;t want to
            have to stop to measure an ingredient. Don&apos;t get distracted, especially in the first few minutes!
        </li>
        <li>
            Saute the garlic only 30 seconds. Be careful not to overcook: you don&apos;t want it to brown!
        </li>
        <li>

        Add flour and whisk constantly. The flour can overcook in an instant, turning a brown color. Only cook it until it&apos;s
        golden.
        </li>
        <li>
        Whisk in the milk gradually. Add just a little milk, then whisk it in. Continue adding little bits until the sauce is
        smooth. Then cook about 5 minutes until thickened, and add the Parmesan and salt. Voila!
           
        </li>
    </ol>
